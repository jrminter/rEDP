# rEDP
An R package to analyze radially-averaged polycrystalline electron diffraction patterns.

This is a re-write of the package `edp` done before the tools provided by roxygen/devtools

## Building

This works well with R-Studio. I use version `0.99.386`.

I build with ``Build > Document``, ``Build > Build and Reload`` and ``Build > Check Package``. I could do this from the command line but the RStudio tools are convenient...
